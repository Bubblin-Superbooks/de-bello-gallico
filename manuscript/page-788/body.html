fortifications, in order that, if occasion should arise, each should
hold and know his own post, orders the cavalry to issue forth from the
camp and commence action. There was a commanding view from the entire
camp, which occupied a ridge of hills; and the minds of all the soldiers

our cavalry. Several of our soldiers were unexpectedly wounded by these,
and left the battle.</p></div> </div>
