The famous line, <em>\"Nil actum reputans si quid superesset\nagendum,\"</em> is a fine feature of the real character, finely expressed.\nBut, if it had been Lucan's purpose (as</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">possibly, with a view to\nPompey's benefit, in some respects it was) utterly and extravagantly to\nfalsify the character of the great Dictator, by no single trait could he\nmore effectually have fulfilled that purpose, nor in fewer words, than\nby this expressive passage, <em>\"Gaudensque viam fecisse ruina.\"</em> Such a\ntrait would be almost extravagant applied even to Marius, who (though in\nmany respects a perfect model of Roman grandeur, massy, columnar,\nimperturbable, and more perhaps than any one man recorded in History\ncapable of justifying the bold illustration of that character in Horace,\n\"<em>Si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidum ferient ruinae</em>\") had, however,\na ferocity in his character, and a touch of the devil in him, very\nrarely united with the same tranquil intrepidity. But, for Caesar, the\nall-accomplished statesman, the splendid orator, the man of elegant\nhabits and polished taste, the patron of the fine arts in a degree\ntranscending all example of his own</p>",

The Attilas and the Tamerlanes, who rejoice in\navowing themselves the scourges of God, and the special instruments of\nhis wrath, have no one feature of affinity to the polished and humane\nCaesar, and would as little have comprehended his character as he could\nhave respected theirs. Even Cato, the unworthy hero of Lucan, might have\nsuggested to him a little more truth in this instance, by a celebrated\nremark which he made on the characteristic distinction of Caesar, in\ncomparison with other revolutionary disturbers; for, said he, whereas\nothers had attempted the overthrow of the state in a continued paroxysm\nof</p>",

It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an\nadvantage to be orphaned at as early age. Perhaps utter orphanage is\nrarely or never such: but to lose a father betimes may, under\nappropriate circumstances, profit a strong mind greatly. To Caesar it\nwas a prodigious benefit that he lost his father when not much more than\nfifteen. Perhaps it was an advantage also to his father that he died\nthus early.</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Had he stayed a year longer, he might have seen himself\ndespised, baffled, and made ridiculous.

  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">should subject to themselves the generations of ordinary men by\nqualities analogous to his. Of this infinite superiority some part must\nbe ascribed to his early emancipation from paternal control. There are\nvery many cases in which, simply from considerations of sex, a female\ncannot stand forward as the head of a family, or as its suitable\nrepresentative. If they are even ladies paramount, and in situations of\ncommand, they are also women. The staff of authority does not annihilate\ntheir sex; and scruples of female delicacy interfere for ever to unnerve\nand emasculate in their hands the sceptre however otherwise potent.\nHence we see, in noble families, the merest boys put forward to\nrepresent the family dignity, as fitter supporters of that burden than\ntheir mature mothers. And of Caesar's mother, though little is recorded,\nand that little incidentally, this much at least we learn—that, if she\nlooked down upon him with maternal pride and</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">delight, she looked up to\nhim with female ambition as the re-edifier of her husband's honours,—\nlooked with reverence as to a column of the Roman grandeur and with fear\nand feminine anxieties as to one whose aspiring spirit carried him but\ntoo prematurely into the fields of adventurous strife. One slight and\nevanescent sketch of the relations which subsisted between Caesar and\nhis mother, caught from the wrecks of time, is preserved both by\nPlutarch and Suetonius. We see in the early dawn the young patrician\nstanding upon the steps of his patrimonial portico, his mother with her\narms wreathed about his neck, looking up to his noble countenance,\nsometimes drawing auguries of hope from features so fitted for command,\nsometimes boding an early blight to promises so dangerously magnificent.\nThat she had something of her son's aspiring character, or that he\npresumed so much in a mother of his, we learn from the few words which\nsurvive of their</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">conversation. He addressed to her no language that\ncould tranquillise her fears. On the contrary, to any but a Roman mother\nhis valedictory words, taken in connexion with the known determination\nof his character, were of a nature to consummate her depression, as they\ntended to confirm the very worst of her fears. He was then going to\nstand his chance in a popular electioneering contest for an office of\nthe highest dignity, and to launch himself upon the storms of the Campus\nMartius. At that period, besides other and more ordinary dangers, the\nbands of gladiators, kept in the pay of the more ambitious or turbulent\namongst the Roman nobles, gave a popular tone of ferocity and of\npersonal risk to the course of such contests; and, either to forestall\nthe victory of an antagonist, or to avenge their own defeat, it was not\nat all impossible that a body of incensed competitors might intercept\nhis final triumph by assassination. For</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">this danger, however, he had no\nleisure in his thoughts of consolation; the sole danger which <em>he</em>\ncontemplated, or supposed his mother to contemplate, was the danger of\ndefeat, and for that he reserved his consolations. He bade her fear\nnothing; for that his determination was to return with victory, and with\nthe ensigns of the dignity he sought, or to return a corpse.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Early indeed did Caesar's trials commence; and it is probable, that, had\nnot the death of his father, by throwing him prematurely upon his own\nresources, prematurely developed the masculine features of his\ncharacter, forcing him whilst yet a boy under the discipline of civil\nconflict and the yoke of practical life, even <em>his</em> energies might have\nbeen insufficient to sustain them. His age is not exactly ascertained;\nbut it is past a doubt that he had not reached his twentieth year when\nhe had the hardihood to engage in a struggle with Sylla, then Dictator,\nand exercising the immoderate powers of</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">that office with the licence and\nthe severity which History has made so memorable. He had neither any\ndistinct grounds of hope, nor any eminent example at that time, to\ncountenance him in this struggle—which yet he pushed on in the most\nuncompromising style, and to the utmost verge of defiance. The subject\nof the contest gives it a further interest. It was the youthful wife of\nthe youthful Caesar who stood under the shadow of the great Dictator's\ndispleasure; not personally, but politically, on account of her\nconnexions: and her it was, Cornelia, the daughter of a man who had been\nfour times consul, that Caesar was required to divorce: but he spurned\nthe haughty mandate, and carried his determination to a triumphant\nissue, notwithstanding his life was at stake, and at one time saved only\nby shifting his place of concealment every night; and this young lady it\nwas who afterwards became the mother of his only daughter. Both</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">mother\nand daughter, it is remarkable, perished prematurely, and at critical\nperiods of Caesar's life; for it is probable enough that these\nirreparable wounds to Caesar's domestic affections threw him with more\nexclusiveness of devotion upon the fascinations of glory and ambition\nthan might have happened under a happier condition of his private life.\nThat Caesar should have escaped destruction in this unequal contest with\nan enemy then wielding the whole thunders of the state, is somewhat\nsurprising; and historians have sought their solution of the mystery in\nthe powerful intercessions of the vestal virgins, and several others of\nhigh rank amongst the connexions of his great house. These may have done\nsomething; but it is due to Sylla, who had a sympathy with everything\ntruly noble, to suppose him struck with powerful admiration for the\naudacity of the young patrician, standing out in such severe solitude\namong so many examples of timid concession; and that</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to this magnanimous\nfeeling in the Dictator much of the indulgence which he showed may have\nbeen really due. In fact, according to some accounts, it was not Sylla,\nbut the creatures of Sylla (<em>adjutores</em>), who pursued Caesar. We know,\nat all events, that Sylla formed a right estimate of Caesar's character,\nand that, from the complexion of his conduct in this one instance, he\ndrew that famous prophecy of his future destiny; bidding his friends\nbeware of that slipshod boy, \"for that in him lay couchant many a\nMarius.\" A grander testimony to the awe which Caesar inspired, or from\none who knew better the qualities of that Cyclopean man by whose scale\nhe measured the patrician boy, cannot be imagined.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is not our intention, or consistent with our plan, to pursue this\ngreat man through the whole circumstances of his romantic career; though\nit is certain that many parts of his life require investigation</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">much\nkeener than has ever been applied to them, and that many might be placed\nin a new light. Indeed, the whole of this most momentous section of\nancient history ought to be recomposed with the critical scepticism of a\nNiebuhr, and the same comprehensive collation, resting, if possible, on\nthe felicitous interpretation of authorities. In reality it is the hinge\nupon which turned the future destiny of the whole earth, and, having\ntherefore a common relation to all modern nations whatsoever, should\nnaturally have been cultivated with the zeal which belongs to a personal\nconcern. In general, the anecdotes which express most vividly the\ngrandeur of character in the first Caesar are those which illustrate his\ndefiance of danger in extremity: the prodigious energy and rapidity of\nhis decisions and motions in the field (looking to which it was that\nCicero called him [Greek: teras] or portentous revelation); the skill\nwith which he penetrated the</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">designs of his enemies, and the electric\nspeed with which he met disasters with remedy and reparation, or, where\nthat was impossible, with relief; the extraordinary presence of mind\nwhich he showed in turning adverse omens to his own advantage, as when,\nupon stumbling in coming on shore (which was esteemed a capital omen of\nevil), he transfigured as it were in one instant its whole meaning by\nexclaiming, \"Thus, and by this contact with the earth, do I take\npossession of thee, O Africa!\" in that way giving to an accident the\nsemblance of a symbolic purpose. Equally conspicuous was the grandeur of\nfortitude with which he faced the whole extent of a calamity when\npalliation could do no good, \"non negando, minuendove, sed insuper\namplificando, <em>ementiendoque</em>\"; as when, upon finding his soldiery\nalarmed at the approach of Juba, with forces really great, but\nexaggerated by their terrors, he addressed them in a military harangue\nto the following</p>",

Therefore, be satisfied; otherwise,\nI will put every man of you on board some crazy old fleet, and whistle\nyou down the tide—no matter under what winds, no matter towards what\nshore.\" Finally, we might seek for <em>characteristic</em> anecdotes of Caesar\nin his unexampled liberalities and contempt of money.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Upon this last topic it is the just remark of Casaubon that some\ninstances of Caesar's munificence have been thought apocryphal, or to\nrest upon false readings, simply from ignorance of the heroic scale upon\nwhich the Roman splendours of that age</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">proceeded. A forum which Caesar\nbuilt out of the products of his last campaign, by way of a present to\nthe Roman people, cost him—for the ground merely on which it stood—\nnearly eight hundred thousand pounds. To the citizens of Rome he\npresented, in one <em>congiary</em>, about two guineas and a half a head. To\nhis army, in one <em>donation</em>, upon the termination of the Civil War, he\ngave a sum which allowed about two hundred pounds a man to the infantry,\nand four hundred to the cavalry. It is true that the legionary troops\nwere then much reduced by the sword of the enemy, and by the tremendous\nhardships of their last campaigns. In this, however, he did perhaps no\nmore than repay a debt. For it is an instance of military attachment,\nbeyond all that Wallenstein or any commander, the most beloved amongst\nhis troops, has ever experienced, that, on the breaking out of the Civil\nWar, not only did the centurions of every legion</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">severally maintain a\nhorse soldier, but even the privates volunteered to serve without pay,\nand (what might seem impossible) without their daily rations. This was\naccomplished by subscriptions amongst themselves, the more opulent\nundertaking for the maintenance of the needy. Their disinterested love\nfor Caesar appeared in another and more difficult illustration: it was a\ntraditionary anecdote in Rome that the majority of those amongst\nCaesar's troops who had the misfortune to fall into the enemy's hands\nrefused to accept their lives under the condition of serving against\n<em>him</em>.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In connexion with this subject of his extraordinary munificence, there\nis one aspect of Caesar's life which has suffered much from the\nmisrepresentations of historians, and that is—the vast pecuniary\nembarrassments under which he laboured, until the profits of war had\nturned the scale even more prodigiously in his favour. At one time of\nhis life, when</p>",

And\nat another he was accustomed to amuse himself with computing how much\nmoney it would require to make him worth exactly nothing (<em>i.e.</em> simply\nto clear him of debts); this, by one account, amounted to upwards of two\nmillions sterling. Now, the error of historians has been to represent\nthese debts as the original ground of his ambition and his revolutionary\nprojects, as though the desperate condition of his private affairs had\nsuggested a civil war to his calculations as the best or only mode of\nredressing it. Such a policy would have resembled the last desperate\nresource of an unprincipled gambler, who, on seeing his final game at\nchess, and the accumulated stakes</p>",

Caesar's debts, far from being\nstimulants and exciting causes of his political ambition, stood in an\ninverse relation to the ambition; they were its results, and represented\nits natural costs, being contracted from first to last in the service of\nhis political intrigues, for raising and maintaining a powerful body of\npartisans, both in Rome and elsewhere.

  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Republic, and placing himself at its head, was no\ngrowth of accident or circumstances; above all, that it did not arise\nupon any so petty and indirect a suggestion as that of his debts; but\nthat his debts were in their very first origin purely ministerial to his\nwise, indispensable, and patriotic ambition; and that his revolutionary\nplans were at all periods of his life a direct and foremost object, but\nin no case bottomed upon casual impulses.

To overthrow the political system of the Republic. This had\nsilently collapsed into an order of things so vicious, growing also so\nhopelessly worse, that all honest patriots invoked a purifying\nrevolution, even though bought at the heavy price of a tyranny, rather\nthan face the chaos of murderous distractions to which the tide of feuds\nand frenzies was violently tending.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Such a revolution at such a price was not less Pompey's object than\nCaesar's.

  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">his rivals. And that he <em>did</em> enter that\narena constructively, and by secret design, from his very earliest\nmanhood, may be gathered from this—that he suffered no openings towards\na revolution, provided they had any hope in them, to escape his\nparticipation. It is familiarly known that he was engaged pretty deeply\nin the conspiracy of Catiline, and that he incurred considerable risk on\nthat occasion; but it is less known that he was a party to at least two\nother conspiracies. There was even a fourth, meditated by Crassus, which\nCaesar so far encouraged as to undertake a journey to Rome from a very\ndistant quarter merely with a view to such chances as it might offer to\nhim; but, as it did not, upon examination, seem to him a very promising\nscheme, he judged it best to look coldly upon it, or not to embark in it\nby any personal co-operation. Upon these and other facts we build our\ninference—that the scheme of a revolution was the one great purpose</p>",
  "page-32": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of\nCaesar from his first entrance upon public life. Nor does it appear that\nhe cared much by whom it was undertaken, provided only there seemed to\nbe any sufficient resources for carrying it through, and for sustaining\nthe first collision with the regular forces of the existing oligarchies,\ntaking or <em>not</em> taking the shape of triumvirates.

From the senator downwards to the lowest <em>faex Romuli</em>, he\nhad a hired body of dependents, both in and out of Rome, equal in\nnumbers to a nation. In the provinces, and in distant kingdoms, he\npursued the same schemes. Everywhere he had a body of mercenary\npartisans; kings even are known to have taken his pay. And it is\nremarkable that even in his character of commander-in-chief, where</p>",
  "page-33": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the\nnumber of legions allowed to him for the accomplishment of his Gaulish\nmission raised him for a number of years above all fear of coercion or\ncontrol, he persevered steadily in the same plan of providing for the\ndistant day when he might need assistance, not <em>from</em> the state, but\n<em>against</em> the state. For, amongst the private anecdotes which came to\nlight under the researches made into his history after his death, was\nthis—that, soon after his first entrance upon his government in Gaul,\nhe had raised, equipped, disciplined, and maintained, from his own\nprivate funds, a legion amounting, possibly, to six or seven thousand\nmen, who were bound to no sacrament of military obedience to the state,\nnor owed fealty to any auspices except those of Caesar. This legion,\nfrom the fashion of their crested helmets, which resembled the heads of\na small aspiring bird, received the popular name of the <em>Alauda</em> (or\nLark) legion. And very singular it was that Cato, or Marcellus,</p>",
  "page-34": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">or some\namongst those enemies of Caesar who watched his conduct during the\nperiod of his Gaulish command with the vigilance of rancorous malice,\nshould not have come to the knowledge of this fact; in which case we may\nbe sure that it would have been denounced to the Senate.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Such, then, for its purpose and its uniform motive, was the sagacious\nmunificence of Caesar. Apart from this motive, and considered in and for\nitself, and simply with a reference to the splendid forms which it often\nassumed, this munificence would furnish the materials for a volume. The\npublic entertainments of Caesar, his spectacles and shows, his\nnaumachiae, and the pomps of his unrivalled triumphs (the closing\ntriumphs of the Republic), were severally the finest of their kind which\nhad then been brought forward. Sea-fights were exhibited upon the\ngrandest scale, according to every known variety of nautical equipment\nand mode of</p>",
  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">conflict, upon a vast lake formed artificially for that\nexpress purpose.

Dramas were represented in every known language (<em>per omnium\nlinguarum histriones</em>). And hence (that is, from the conciliatory\nfeeling thus expressed towards the various tribes of foreigners resident\nin Rome) some have derived an explanation of what is else a mysterious\ncircumstance amongst the ceremonial observances at Caesar's funeral—\nthat all people of foreign nations then residing at Rome distinguished\nthemselves by the conspicuous share which they took in the public\nmourning; and that, beyond all other foreigners, the Jews for night\nafter night kept watch and ward about the Emperor's grave. Never before,\naccording to traditions which lasted through several generations</p>",
  "page-36": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in\nRome, had there been so vast a conflux of the human race congregated to\nany one centre, on any one attraction of business or of pleasure, as to\nRome on occasion of these triumphal spectacles exhibited by Caesar.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In our days, the greatest occasional gatherings of the human race are in\nIndia, especially at the great fair of the <em>Hurdwar</em> on the Ganges in\nnorthern Hindustan: a confluence of some millions is sometimes seen at\nthat spot, brought together under the mixed influences of devotion and\ncommercial business, but very soon dispersed as rapidly as they had been\nconvoked. Some such spectacle of nations crowding upon nations, and some\nsuch Babylonian confusion of dresses, complexions, languages, and\njargons, was then witnessed at Rome. Accommodations within doors, and\nunder roofs of houses, or roofs of temples, was altogether impossible.\nMyriads encamped along the</p>",
  "page-37": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">streets, and along the high-roads, fields, or\ngardens. Myriads lay stretched on the ground, without even the slight\nprotection of tents, in a vast circuit about the city. Multitudes of\nmen, even senators, and others of the highest rank, were trampled to\ndeath in the crowds. And the whole family of man might seem at that time\nto be converged at the bidding of the dead Dictator. But these, or any\nother themes connected with the public life of Caesar, we notice only in\nthose circumstances which have been overlooked, or partially\nrepresented, by historians. Let us now, in conclusion, bring forward,\nfrom the obscurity in which they have hitherto lurked, the anecdotes\nwhich describe the habits of his private life, his tastes, and personal\npeculiarities.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In person, he was tall, fair, gracile, and of limbs distinguished for\ntheir elegant proportions. His eyes were black and piercing. These\ncircumstances continued to be long remembered, and no doubt</p>",
  "page-38": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">were\nconstantly recalled to the eyes of all persons in the imperial palaces\nby pictures, busts, and statues; for we find the same description of his\npersonal appearance three centuries afterwards in a work of the Emperor\nJulian's. He was a most accomplished horseman, and a master\n(<em>peritissimus</em>) in the use of arms. But, notwithstanding his skill and\nhorsemanship, it seems that, when he accompanied his army on marches, he\nwalked oftener than he rode; no doubt, with a view to the benefit of his\nexample, and to express that sympathy with his soldiers which gained him\ntheir hearts so entirely. On other occasions, when travelling apart from\nhis army, he seems more frequently to have ridden in a carriage than on\nhorseback. His purpose, in this preference, must have been with a view\nto the transport of luggage. The carriage which he generally used was a\n<em>rheda</em>, a sort of gig, or rather curricle; for it was a <em>four</em>-wheeled\ncarriage, and adapted (as we find from the</p>",
  "page-39": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">imperial regulations for the\npublic carriages, etc.) to the conveyance of about half a ton. The mere\npersonal baggage which Caesar carried with him was probably\nconsiderable; for he was a man of elegant habits, and in all parts of\nhis life sedulously attentive to elegance of personal appearance. The\nlength of journeys which he accomplished within a given time appears\neven to us at this day, and might well therefore appear to his\ncontemporaries, truly astonishing. A distance of one hundred miles was\nno extraordinary day's journey for him in a <em>rheda</em>, such as we have\ndescribed it. So refined were his habits, and so constant his demand for\nthe luxurious accommodations of polished life as it then existed in\nRome, that he is said to have carried with him, as indispensable parts\nof his personal baggage, the little ivory lozenges, squares and circles\nor ovals, with other costly materials, wanted for the tessellated\nflooring of his tent. Habits such as these will easily</p>",
  "page-40": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">account for his\ntravelling in a carriage rather than on horseback.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The courtesy and obliging disposition of Caesar were notorious; and both\nwere illustrated in some anecdotes which survived for generations in\nRome. Dining on one occasion, as an invited guest, at a table where the\nservants had inadvertently, for salad-oil, furnished some sort of coarse\nlamp-oil, Caesar would not allow the rest of the company to point out\nthe mistake to their host, for fear of shocking him too much by exposing\nwhat might have been construed into inhospitality. At another time,\nwhilst halting at a little <em>cabaret</em>, when one of his retinue was\nsuddenly taken ill, Caesar resigned to his use the sole bed which the\nhouse afforded.
