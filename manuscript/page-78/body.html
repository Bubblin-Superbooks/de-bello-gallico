but if he should persist in persecuting them with war, that he ought to
remember both the ancient disgrace of the Roman people and the

they had so learned from their sires and ancestors, as to rely more on
valour than on artifice or stratagem. Wherefore let him not bring it to
pass that the place, where they were standing, should acquire a name,
from the disaster of the Roman people and the destruction of their army
or transmit the remembrance [of such an event to posterity]."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
