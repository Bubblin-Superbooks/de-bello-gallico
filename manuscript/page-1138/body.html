the wall, and in the front by the mantlets, carried whatever materials
were necessary for the building without danger: the business was soon
finishedâ€”the loss of their laborious work was soon repaired by the
dexterity and fortitude of the soldiers. Gates for making sallies were
left in the wall in such places as they thought proper.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
