<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5 class="center">Notations in the book</h5><p class="  start-chapter">Macrons, breves, umlauts etc have been removed from the body of the text
since they were very obtrusive and made reading difficult. However, they
are retained in the Index for reference. The convention used for these marks is:
</p>
   <ul><li>Macron (straight line over letter):  [=x]</li>
    <li>Umlaut (2 dots over letter):         [:x]</li>
    <li>Grave accent:                        [Â°x]</li>
    <li>Acute accent:                        ['x]</li>
    <li>Circumflex:                          [^x]</li>
    <li>Breve (u-shaped symbol over letter): [)x]</li>
    <li>Cedilla                             [,x]</li>
  </ul>
