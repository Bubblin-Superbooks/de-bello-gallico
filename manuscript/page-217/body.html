was this: A hill, declining evenly from the top, extended to the river
Sambre, which we have mentioned above: from this river there arose a
![second] hill of like ascent, on the other side and opposite to the
former, and open from about 200 paces at the lowest part; but in the
upper part, woody, (so much so) that it was not easy to see through it
into the interior. Within those woods the enemy kept themselves in
concealment; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on the open ground,
along the river. The depth of the river was about three feet.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
